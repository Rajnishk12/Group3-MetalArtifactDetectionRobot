# Group3-MetalArtifactDetectionRobot

Detecting metal artifacts is crucial for various applications, such as environmental cleanup, archaeological studies, and safety assessments. As metal debris becomes more prevalent in many areas, effective detection methods are vital for reducing risks and aiding recovery efforts. Conventional detection approaches can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, underscoring the need for innovative technological solutions.

This project focuses on creating a mobile robotic platform based on an Arduino Uno Rev 3 4WD car that incorporates advanced detection capabilities. By integrating a metal detector sensor, ultrasonic sensors, and GPS modules, the robot will autonomously navigate and accurately locate buried metal artifacts. The use of servo motors will improve the robot's mobility and agility, enabling it to handle challenging terrains.

This prototype will bring theoretical concepts to life, allowing for real-time detection and mapping of metal artifacts. Through this endeavour, we aim to showcase the potential of combining robotics with sensor technology for efficient metal detection, paving the way for future advancements in the field.
